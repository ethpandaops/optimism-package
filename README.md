## Welcome to Optimism Package
The default package for Optimism. The kurtosis package uses [op-deployer](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-deployer) to manage
the L2 chains and all associated artifacts such as contract deployments.

```yaml
optimism_package:
  chains:
    - participants:
        - el_type: op-geth
          cl_type: op-node
        - el_type: op-reth
        - el_type: op-erigon
        - el_type: op-nethermind
ethereum_package:
  network_params:
    preset: minimal
```

Please note, by default your network will be running a `minimal` preset Ethereum network. Click [here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/configs/minimal.yaml) to learn more about minimal preset. You can [customize](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package) the L1 Ethereum network by modifying the `ethereum_package` configuration.

You can also completely remove `ethereum_package` from your configuration in which case it will default to a `minimal` preset Ethereum network.

## Quickstart
#### Run with your own configuration

Kurtosis packages are parameterizable, meaning you can customize your network and its behavior to suit your needs by storing parameters in a file that you can pass in at runtime like so:

```bash
kurtosis run github.com/ethpandaops/optimism-package --args-file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethpandaops/optimism-package/main/network_params.yaml
```

For `--args-file` parameters file, you can pass a local file path or a URL to a file.

To clean up running enclaves and data, you can run:

```bash
kurtosis clean -a
```

This will stop and remove all running enclaves and **delete all data**.

#### Run with changes to the optimism package

If you are attempting to test any changes to the package code, you can point to the directory as the `run` argument

```bash
cd ~/go/src/github.com/ethpandaops/optimism-package
kurtosis run . --args-file ./network_params.yaml
```

# L2 Contract deployer
The enclave will automatically deploy an optimism L2 contract on the L1 network. The contract address will be printed in the logs. You can use this contract address to interact with the L2 network.

Please refer to this Dockerfile if you want to see how the contract deployer image is built: [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ethpandaops/eth-client-docker-image-builder/blob/master/op-contract-deployer/Dockerfile)


## Configuration

To configure the package behaviour, you can modify your `network_params.yaml` file and use that as the input to `--args-file`.
The full YAML schema that can be passed in is as follows with the defaults provided:

```

### Additional configuration recommendations

#### L1 customization

It is required you to launch an L1 Ethereum node to interact with the L2 network. You can use the `ethereum_package` to launch an Ethereum node. The `ethereum_package` configuration is as follows:

```yaml
optimism_package:
  chains:
    - participants:
        - el_type: op-geth
          cl_type: op-node
      additional_services:
        - blockscout
ethereum_package:
  participants:
    - el_type: geth
    - el_type: reth
  network_params:
    preset: minimal
  additional_services:
    - dora
    - blockscout
```

#### L2 customization with Hard Fork transitions

To spin up an L2 chain with specific hard fork transition blocks and any local docker image to run the EL/CL components,
use the `network_params` section of your arguments file to specify the hard fork transitions and custom images.

```yaml
optimism_package:
  chains:
    - participants:
      - el_type: op-geth
        el_image: "us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-geth:<tag>"
        cl_type: op-node
        cl_image: "us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-node:<tag>"
      - el_type: op-geth
        el_image: "us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-geth:<tag>"
        cl_type: op-node
        cl_image: "us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-node:<tag>"
      network_params:
        fjord_time_offset: 0
        granite_time_offset: 0
        holocene_time_offset: 4
        isthmus_time_offset: 8
```

#### Multiple L2 chains

Additionally, you can spin up multiple L2 networks by providing a list of L2 configuration parameters like so:

```yaml
optimism_package:
  chains:
    - participants:
        - el_type: op-geth
      network_params:
        name: op-rollup-one
        network_id: "3151909"
      additional_services:
        - blockscout
    - participants:
        - el_type: op-geth
      network_params:
        name: op-rollup-two
        network_id: "3151910"
      additional_services:
        - blockscout
ethereum_package:
  participants:
    - el_type: geth
    - el_type: reth
  network_params:
    preset: minimal
  additional_services:
    - dora
    - blockscout
```
Note: if configuring multiple L2s, make sure that the `network_id` and `name` are set to differentiate networks.
