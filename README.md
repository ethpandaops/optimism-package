# Welcome to Optimism Package

The default package for Optimism. The kurtosis package uses [op-deployer](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-deployer) to manage
the L2 chains and all associated artifacts such as contract deployments.

```yaml
optimism_package:
  chains:
    - participants:
        - el_type: op-geth
          cl_type: op-node
        - el_type: op-reth
        - el_type: op-erigon
        - el_type: op-nethermind
ethereum_package:
  network_params:
    preset: minimal
    genesis_delay: 5
    additional_preloaded_contracts: '
      {
        "0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C": {
          "balance": "0ETH",
          "code": "0x7fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe03601600081602082378035828234f58015156039578182fd5b8082525050506014600cf3",
          "storage": {},
          "nonce": "1"
        }
      }
    '

```

Please note, by default your network will be running a `minimal` preset Ethereum network. Click [here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/configs/minimal.yaml) to learn more about minimal preset. You can [customize](https://github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package) the L1 Ethereum network by modifying the `ethereum_package` configuration.

You can also completely remove `ethereum_package` from your configuration in which case it will default to a `minimal` preset Ethereum network.

## Quickstart

### Run with your own configuration

Kurtosis packages are parameterizable, meaning you can customize your network and its behavior to suit your needs by storing parameters in a file that you can pass in at runtime like so:

```bash
kurtosis run github.com/ethpandaops/optimism-package --args-file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethpandaops/optimism-package/main/network_params.yaml
```

For `--args-file` parameters file, you can pass a local file path or a URL to a file.

To clean up running enclaves and data, you can run:

```bash
kurtosis clean -a
```

This will stop and remove all running enclaves and **delete all data**.

### Run with changes to the optimism package

If you are attempting to test any changes to the package code, you can point to the directory as the `run` argument

```bash
cd ~/go/src/github.com/ethpandaops/optimism-package
kurtosis run . --args-file ./network_params.yaml
```

## L2 Contract deployer

The enclave will automatically deploy an optimism L2 contract on the L1 network. The contract address will be printed in the logs. You can use this contract address to interact with the L2 network.

Please refer to this Dockerfile if you want to see how the contract deployer image is built: [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/op-deployer/Dockerfile.default)

## Configuration

To configure the package behaviour, you can modify your `network_params.yaml` file and use that as the input to `--args-file`.
The full YAML schema that can be passed in is as follows with the defaults provided:

```yaml
optimism_package:
  # Observability configuration
  observability:
    # Whether or not to configure observability (e.g. prometheus)
    enabled: true
    # Default prometheus configuration

  #
  # For simplicity we currently enforce chains to all be altda or all rollups.
  # Adding a single altda chain to a cluster essentially makes all chains have altda levels of security.
  #
  # To setup an altda cluster, make sure to
  # 1. Set altda_deploy_config.use_altda to true (and da_commitment_type to KeccakCommitment, see TODO below)
  # 2. For each chain,
  #    - Add "da_server" to the additional_services list if it should use alt-da
  #    - For altda chains, set da_server_params to use an image and cmd of your choice (one could use da-server, another eigenda-proxy, another celestia proxy, etc). If unset, op's default da-server image will be used.
  altda_deploy_config:
    use_altda: false
    # TODO: Is this field redundant? Afaiu setting it to GenericCommitment will not deploy the
    # DAChallengeContract, and hence is equivalent to setting use_altda to false.
    # Furthermore, altda rollups using generic commitments might anyways need to support failing over
    # to keccak commitments if the altda layer is down.
    da_commitment_type: KeccakCommitment
    da_challenge_window: 100
    da_resolve_window: 100

### Additional configuration recommendations

#### L1 customization

It is required for you to launch an L1 Ethereum node to interact with the L2 network. You can use the `ethereum_package` to launch an Ethereum node. The `ethereum_package` configuration is as follows:

```yaml
optimism_package:
  chains:
    - participants:
        - el_type: op-geth
          cl_type: op-node
      additional_services:
        - blockscout
ethereum_package:
  participants:
    - el_type: geth
    - el_type: reth
  network_params:
    preset: minimal
    genesis_delay: 5
    additional_preloaded_contracts: '
      {
        "0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C": {
          "balance": "0ETH",
          "code": "0x7fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe03601600081602082378035828234f58015156039578182fd5b8082525050506014600cf3",
          "storage": {},
          "nonce": "1"
        }
      }
    '
  additional_services:
    - dora
    - blockscout
```

#### L2 customization with Hard Fork transitions

To spin up an L2 chain with specific hard fork transition blocks and any local docker image to run the EL/CL components,
use the `network_params` section of your arguments file to specify the hard fork transitions and custom images.

```yaml
optimism_package:
  chains:
    - participants:
      - el_type: op-geth
        el_image: "us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-geth:<tag>"
        cl_type: op-node
        cl_image: "us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-node:<tag>"

        el_image: "us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-geth:<tag>"

        cl_image: "us-docker.pkg.dev/oplabs-tools-artifacts/images/op-node:<tag>"

#### Multiple L2 chains

Additionally, you can spin up multiple L2 networks by providing a list of L2 configuration parameters like so:

```yaml
optimism_package:
  chains:
    - participants:
        - el_type: op-geth
      network_params:
        name: op-rollup-one
        network_id: "3151909"
      additional_services:
        - blockscout
    - participants:
        - el_type: op-geth
      network_params:
        name: op-rollup-two
        network_id: "3151910"
      additional_services:
        - blockscout
ethereum_package:
  participants:
    - el_type: geth
    - el_type: reth
  network_params:
    preset: minimal
    genesis_delay: 5
    additional_preloaded_contracts: '
      {
        "0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C": {
          "balance": "0ETH",
          "code": "0x7fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe03601600081602082378035828234f58015156039578182fd5b8082525050506014600cf3",
          "storage": {},
          "nonce": "1"
        }
      }
    '
  additional_services:
    - dora
    - blockscout
```

Note: if configuring multiple L2s, make sure that the `network_id` and `name` are set to differentiate networks.

#### Rollup Boost for External Block Building

Rollup Boost is a sidecar to the sequencer op-node that allows blocks to be built by an external builder on the L2 network.

To use rollup boost, you can add `rollup-boost` as an additional service and configure the `mev_params` section of your arguments file to specify the rollup boost image. Optionally, you can specify the host and port of an external builder outside of the Kurtosis enclave.

```yaml
optimism_package:
  chains:
    - participants:
        - el_builder_type: op-geth
          cl_builder_type: op-node
      mev_params:
        rollup_boost_image: "flashbots/rollup-boost:latest"
        builder_host: "localhost"
        builder_port: "8545"
      additional_services:
        - rollup-boost
```

#### Run tx-fuzz to send l2 transactions

Compile [tx-fuzz](https://github.com/MariusVanDerWijden/tx-fuzz) locally per instructions in the repo. Run tx-fuzz against the l2 EL client's RPC URL and using the pre-funded wallet:

```bash
./livefuzzer spam  --sk "0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80" --rpc http://127.0.0.1:<port> --slot-time 2
```

### Additional configurations

Please find examples of additional configurations in the [test folder](.github/tests/).

### Useful Kurtosis commands

#### Inspect enclave -- Container/Port information

- List information about running containers and open ports

```bash
kurtosis enclave ls
kurtosis enclave inspect <enclave-name>
```

- Inspect chain state.

```bash
kurtosis files inspect <enclave-name> op-deployer-configs
```

- Dump all files generated by kurtosis to disk (for inspecting chain state/deploy configs/contract addresses etc.). A file that contains an exhaustive
  set of information about the current deployment is `files/op-deployer-configs/state.json`. Deployed contract address, roles etc can all be found here.

```bash
# dumps all files to a enclave-name prefixed directory under the current directory
kurtosis enclave dump <enclave-name>
kurtosis files download <enclave-name> op-deployer-configs <where-to-download>
```

- Get logs for running services

```bash
kurtosis service logs <enclave-name> <service-name> -f . # -f tails the log
```

- Stop/Start running service (restart sequencer/batcher/op-geth etc.)

```bash
kurtosis service stop <enclave-name> <service-name>
kurtosis service start <enclave-name> <service-name>
```
